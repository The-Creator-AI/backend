    "description": "Integrate SQLite database support into the backend application to enable persistent data storage and retrieval.",
    "acceptance_criteria": [
        "The backend application should successfully connect to a SQLite database.",
        "The backend should be able to create and manipulate tables within the SQLite database.",
        "The application should be able to store and retrieve data from the SQLite database.",
        "The backend should handle database operations gracefully, providing appropriate error handling for connection failures, data access issues, and other potential problems.",
        "The backend should be able to query the SQLite database efficiently, returning the requested data in a timely manner.",
        "The database interactions should be properly integrated with the existing backend codebase, ensuring seamless functionality.",
        "The backend should implement transactional behavior, ensuring data integrity by committing changes only if all operations within a transaction succeed.",
        "The backend should implement rollbacks, reverting any changes made within a transaction if an error occurs during any operation within the transaction."
